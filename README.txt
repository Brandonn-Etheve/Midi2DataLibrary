This is an enhanced version of the original midi2text application found [here](http://explodingart.com/jmusic/applications.html).

It has been modified to fix some bugs and include additional information about the midi file. [Here is an example file output.](https://github.com/Yxven/Midi2Text/blob/master/README.txt)

This program includes JMusic1.6.4.jar which was originally found <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmusic/files/jMusic_Stable/">here</a> and is licensed
under GPLv2.
